TODO:

1. Create components for text, checkbox inputs and button. These components should have two states: view and edit so
we can easily create edit forms from view when nessecesary.

2. Add prop types to components.

3. Create two tabs: done and not done TODOs. Make checkbox of todo on the main page editable.

QUESTIONS:

1. Do I need to create View and Edit components or create generic component that takes
a mode props and show either View or Edit inputs.
What I found on the internet that people using conditioning to do this.

2. How to create breadcrumbs component? When I am using react-router I need to import components that are on the
page specified in the breadcrumbs (it looks really hard to overcome and definitely not the best way
to solve this problem).

3. How to stop opening new page when clicking a link ?
I used to use <a> tag for links. To stop opening new pages I just replaced
<a> with <Link>
