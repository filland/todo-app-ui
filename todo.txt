QUESTIONS:

1. Do I need to create View and Edit components or create generic component that takes
a mode props and show either View or Edit inputs.
What I found on the internet that people using conditioning to do this.

2. How to create breadcrumbs component? When I am using react-router I need to import components that are on the
page specified in the breadcrumbs (it looks really hard to overcome and definitely not the best way
to solve this problem).
